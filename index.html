        <p>I still don't know how to make website, so I stole thy bootstrapz sample example thingy. <br><br>
		There's nothing in my github, but you can look at it for no reason. I tried to do shader programmings in Unity at one point. But that's about it.<br><br>
		I like to do the programmings. I don't go to school. Learning two hard. The languages I kind of know with at least one day of experience are: 
		<ul> 
			<li><strong>C++</strong>,</li> 
			<li><strong>C#</strong> (mainly in the game engine, Unity),</li> 
			<li><strong>Python</strong>,</li> 
			<li>and something <strong>else</strong></li> 
		</ul>
		Small challenges on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/TheDrw"><strong>codewars</strong></a> is pretty excitings. You should try it. Well, you don't have to. Actually, you should. Currently, I am learning
		the very unreal, but is real, unreal engine to figure out stuff. Also, is trying some rear-end things, er, I mean, back-end things with pythong.<br><br>
		
		Streaming is cool, two. I don't do it that much, I do it sometimes on the twitch land. You should follow it and never look back. <br><br>
		
		There's also some other social media things like youtube and instagram. You could follow those and never message me. I have a facebook, but I never go on it anymore. Facebook loop too stronk. 
		I only go on the messenger thing. So if I never accept your friend request or respond to your things on there, don't take it personally. 
		Actually, take it personally. You shouldn't have me tell you how to feel. Nevermind, don't take it too personal. <br><br>
		
		This is my current pc: <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/R4zkNN"><strong> my computor. </strong></a> Ryzen 1700 is overclocked at 3.8 jiggaHurtz at ~1.337v or somethin' and 
		the mammories are at 2.934 MHz with 14-15-15-35 timings if you wanted to know dat.
